### OAuth Token
`spotify-playlist-merge` currently uses a temporary OAuth token to keep things simple. This token can be generated from the [Spotify Interactive Console](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-playlist/) and hitting the "GET OAUTH TOKEN" button. In addition, you will need to grant the following scope permissions as seen below depending on the which playlist you are trying to modify.

- playlist-read-private
- playlist-read-collaborative
- playlist-modify-public
- playlist-modify-private

### Playlist ID & Spotify ID
1. Open the [Spotify Web Player](https://play.spotify.com), and navigate to your playlist or the desired playlist to copy
2. Your URL should look the following: 
`https://open.spotify.com/user/janedoe/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4WYpdgoIcn6` or `https://open.spotify.com/user/1234819/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4WYpdgoIcn6`
3. The `37i9dQZF1DX4WYpdgoIcn6` in the URL is your playlist ID
4. The `jandoe` or `1234819` are the Spotify IDs to enter when prompted
